It appears that there was an issue with using the tool for retrieving fundamental information about "BITCOIN," potentially because "BITCOIN" as a ticker may not be supported or the tool cannot access cryptocurrency data directly. 

Since Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency and not a traditional stock or company ticker, the usual fundamental analysis tools for companies do not apply directly to Bitcoin. Instead, I can provide a comprehensive update based on the latest available information about Bitcoin as of July 16, 2025, including its market trends, recent news, and key metrics relevant to traders.

Would you like me to proceed with a detailed qualitative and quantitative overview of Bitcoin's current status, or do you have specific aspects you'd like to focus on?
